## Overview


## Analysis
Robot weight.

The weight of the robot was one of our initial concerns, and we consequently used lighter materials in the construction of the robot. We still used the aluminum extrusions for our base frame, but instead of using wood or metal for our second level, we used an acrylic sheet that would allow us to easily mount everything we needed. We also used a 3-D printer to print any extra additions we needed, including a mount for the PiCamera (which will be used in future projects), a base for the Lidar and RPi (using the same design as the one from last semester), and small blocks that allow us to lower our caster wheels to the same height as the skateboard wheels.   

Base dimensions (include the add-ons).

Max speed (linear, angular).
The wheel has a radius of 8.4 cm.

Payload capacity.

Battery (minimum) life span
When constructing the robot, we considered the battery life and decided to have two separate power supplies: one to power the motors and one to power the Raspberry Pi and the RPi Pico.
